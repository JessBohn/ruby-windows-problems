When trying to update rubygems or any ruby gem I receive this following error:

  ERROR:  Could not find a valid gem 'rubygems-update' (= 2.6.6), here is why:
        Unable to download data from https://rubygems.org/ -
        SSL_connect returned=1 errno=0 state=SSLv3 read server certificate B:
        certificate verify failed (https://api.rubygems.org/specs.4.8.gz)

The specific message above was being received when trying to run 'gem install
rubygems-update', which meant that I could not even run the gem installation
to update my rubygems

Actual problem:
  Some of the versions of RubyGems are unstable and their infrastructure is
  different than the stable versions, which is most versions. The version of
  RubyGems that I had installed must have had a bug in it where the link SSL
  Certification was missing, which was preventing the connection to rubygems.org
  where your computer requests the information for each gem. This prevented any
  gem, including RubyGems, from being installed and/or updated.


SOLUTION:
    (*If you want to update to the most recent version of RubyGems)
    Go to:
      https://rubygems.org/pages/download#formats

    (You can simply follow the instructions there or read my synopsis below)
    Download the latest version of RubyGems ( I chose to download ZIP file )
    For best practices and to better keep track of your gem information, move
    the file to the directory where all of your other Ruby/Rails setup files
    are kept. After you have moved the folder, go to your command line and
    cd to this directory then run
      'ruby setup.rb'
    This should have updated whichever version of RubyGems you had to now the most
    recent version. Test this by trying to install a new gem.
      'gem install gamertag'
    Yes, that's a real gem. If you already have that gem test a different one.
    If you no longer receive the above error message then you have successfully
    solved your SSL Certification Error! Rejoice.
