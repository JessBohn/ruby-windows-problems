When trying to update rubygems or any ruby gem I receive this following error:

  ERROR:  Could not find a valid gem 'rubygems-update' (= 2.6.6), here is why:
        Unable to download data from https://rubygems.org/ -
        SSL_connect returned=1 errno=0 state=SSLv3 read server certificate B:
        certificate verify failed (https://api.rubygems.org/specs.4.8.gz)

The specific message above was being received when trying to run 'gem install
rubygems-update', which meant that I could not even run the gem installation
to update my rubygems

Actual problem:
  Some of the versions of RubyGems are unstable and their infrastructure is
  different than the stable versions, which is most versions. The version of
  RubyGems that I had installed must have had a bug in it where the link SSL
  Certification was missing, which was preventing the connection to rubygems.org
  where your computer requests the information for each gem. This prevented any
  gem, including RubyGems, from being installed and/or updated.
